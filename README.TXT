It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.


****Answers***

1) After the ticket is printed,the balance goes to zero. 
2) If you insert to much, it will still just give a balance of zero, if you don't put enough it will also give a balance of zero and give you the ticket with the amount on it. 
3) The new machine will print a ticket with the different price but it will not change that mcuh from the other machine ticket.
4) The outer wraper of the Student and LabClass I think are more elaborate.
5) There is a change when you switch the places of class and public, the green part goes away and there are errors everywhere.
As you compile it says error in class but does not explain further.
6) You can leave out the word public.
7) If the word class is left out then it gives and error. 
8) The one constructor is TicketMachine, the field is getbalance and getprice, for method it is insertMoney and printTicket.
9) The constructor stores values and it has the same name as the class.
10)They are int, Student, and Server.
11)alive,tutor,game.
12)Student, Server, Person, and Game.
13)It says <identifier> expected and it does not compile. I also don't think that there are other ways to order it.
14)It is necessary since it won't compile or run without it.
15)public int status() 
16)Student
17)There are two parameters, and the types are string and double.
18)Names of books and prices of books. We can see that they would have a price and a name.
19)public Pet(String petsName)
{
    name=petsName;
}
20)The names are different. 
21)"What is the amount of money stored"
22)When changed to getAmount it still worked, which tells us that the name of accesor method does not need to be the same as the feild associated with it.
23)When return statment is removed, the error message shows that it is missing it.
24)One has int for integer and the other has void because it is running a function.
25)It shows the negative integer that I used for the insert money on the get balance.
26)When price changed to = price, the inspect shows nothing different.
27)It will say " My cat has green eyes"
28)It would give the word print next to cent.
29)It would will print all of it together.
30)They show different prices.
31)
